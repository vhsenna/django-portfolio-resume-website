          <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
          <hr>
          <p>Six months after writing my first Hello World program on January 2021 I had convinced my boss to let me
            take
            a stab at building a better version of the outdated laboratory management system my company was running on.
          </p>
          <p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine. My newbie self was now in charge
            of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients.</p>
          <p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

          <p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>
          <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code
            where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

          <h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
          <hr>
          <p>After almost two years of supporting my system at the lab I'm ready to learn something new. I'll
            collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my blog (SayHelloWorld.co) & YouTube channel.</p>
          <p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team &
            learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
